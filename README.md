## Hi, I’m Christopher Mendoza (he/him) 👋

I’m an investor and applied AI builder based in San Diego, CA. I lead research at an institutional money manager and I’m completing the **M.S. in Applied Artificial Intelligence** at the University of San Diego. I like turning messy, real-world problems into working prototypes: clear objective, clean data, measurable evaluation, and a deployable workflow.

### Focus Areas
- Applied ML prototypes (classification, forecasting, NLP, computer vision)
- Financial research tooling (data pipelines, valuation helpers, decision support)
- MLOps foundations (reproducible experiments, monitoring, CI/CD patterns)
- Practical agent workflows (retrieval + structured outputs + evaluation)

## Languages & Tools
Python • pandas • scikit-learn • PyTorch/TensorFlow • Jupyter • SQL • AWS • GitHub Actions
