## Hi, I’m Christopher Mendoza (he/him) 👋

I’m an investor and applied AI builder based in San Diego, CA. I lead research at an institutional money manager and I’m completing the **M.S. in Applied Artificial Intelligence** at the University of San Diego. I like turning messy, real-world problems into working prototypes: clear objective, clean data, measurable evaluation, and a deployable workflow.

### Focus Areas
- Applied AI/ML prototypes (classification, forecasting, NLP, computer vision)
- Financial research tooling (data pipelines, valuation helpers, decision support)
- MLOps foundations (reproducible experiments, monitoring, CI/CD patterns)
- Practical agent workflows (retrieval + structured outputs + evaluation)

## Featured Projects

### 🧠 BeautyScoreCV – Computer Vision Regression
- Built an exploratory CV pipeline to predict a continuous aesthetic score from facial images.
- Focused on image preprocessing, CNN-based feature learning, and regression evaluation.
- Emphasized model mechanics and limitations rather than subjective claims.
- **Tech:** Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow/PyTorch, Jupyter  
- **Repo:** https://github.com/wushuchris/beautyscorecv
